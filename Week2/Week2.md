## Purpose

To learn how to use a new software environment with the aim of understanding some principles of the use of command line tools



## Introduction

The biological world has got much more quantitative and analytical as the way biology is now performed has changed.  Data volumes have increased markedly, and so has our requirement and ability to analyse such data.  The first part of “Bootcamp” will introduce you to two tools that will be used throughout the course:  the statistical software package R and the UNIX command line.  This will be followed up with a look into data visualisation in the third week.

Week 2 focusses on an environment used by many computational scientists, those studying biology and many other disciplines.  This environment is the UNIX command line, and takes us back to the days before everything was graphical and ‘point and click’ based.  This is a very powerful and useful way to analyse biological data, and we will start learning the basics of how to work in this different environment.



## Lecture overview

As a brief summary of the lecture, we learnt that Unix has been around for 50 years or so, and in some ways it is still quite similar to those initial operating systems (OS).  It could be argued it has suffered from being very basic in its visual richness, and in that regard it has not advanced much.  Under the hood, how it works, and its usability is a completely different matter.  If you are interested -- and yes, you can do this is this lab -- have a look at the following URL that gives a quick view of the evolution of Microsoft Windows as a comparison:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/from-windows-1-to-windows-10-29-years-of-windows-evolution

Windows has clearly come on a long way with a shorter history than Unix. You will also remember from the lecture that the current version of the Apple OS -- OS X (and later named versions of places in California) -- are also based on Unix.  That is why we could very easily get the basics of using the command line using a terminal on our iMacs we use for this course at Manawatu.  There is no need to install any other way to perform command line applications.  Windows machines (like those at Albany) cannot easily run Linux/Unix without additional software.  


<table><tr><td>
<strong>Note:</strong> The practicals for 203311 this year are being performed inside a new cloud-based RStudio environment called "RStudio Cloud". We will discuss the use of this shortly. 
</td></tr></table>


This lab practical is on basic usage of Linux/Unix.  From now on we will call this Linux.  We will explore some commands and try to work with a set of small files. Your aim is to get familiar with this environment, so when we use them for the rest of the course, you have the knowledge to perform the tasks asked for, as well as others we shall learn. 

This module is an introduction to the worlds of Linux and R, with a mastery test as an assessment.  Please use this practical lab as a learning experience for a new set of tools, which in this case might go beyond this course, and into future study.

Windows and macOS are very powerful OS and thousands of people working on their development to make them the polished products they are.  However, the time it takes new features and programs to be incorporated takes a very long time because of the huge corporations they have become.  

This is why a large part of scientific research computing uses Unix/Linux as an environment within which to work.  We can access new programs, try them out, and use them in our research if we want to.  We have greater control over the parameters and options that come with the programs.  In other words, many of these programs do not suffer from the "black box" nature of Windows and macOS, i.e. we do not know how they fully work under the surface.  The number of new programs for genome analysis that you can download is growing all the time.  Let's first go through some of the programs that come with a standard installation of Linux so that you can work with files and directories.

First thing, don't copy and paste in the practical today!  Why?  Typing these commands is part of the hard wiring required to make them stick!  Also, "with great power comes great responsibility", and the way you are working today has the power to wipe a computer -- no trash recovery -- completely gone forever (except for that system-wide backup you have made right?)!  By typing commands, it gives you another opportunity to think about the command before you execute it and typing is more likely to trigger a big red flag in dangerous situations!  **_Think twice, type once._**

**This module is an introduction to the worlds of Linux and R, with a mastery test as an assessment. Please use this practical lab as a learning experience for a new set of tools, which in this case might go beyond this course, and into future study.**



## Conventions used for this Linux practical

In what follows, we shall use the following typographical conventions:

- Characters written in `this programming style`, e.g. `ls` are commands to be typed into the computer as they stand.
- Characters written in italics like _`this programming style`_, e.g. _`file.txt`_ indicate non-specific file or directory names.
- Words within double arrows such as \<\<this\>\> are examples.
- Words inserted within square brackets [Ctrl] indicate keys to be pressed.

So, for example,

```bash
$ ls <<anydirectory>> [Enter]	- {NOTE: do not do this, it is an example.}
```
  
means "at the UNIX prompt $, type `ls` followed by the name of some directory, then press the key marked Enter."

Don't forget to press the [Enter] key: commands are not sent to the computer until this is done.



## Accessing the resources needed

### Computing

#### General

We will be working within web browsers, and Firefox and Chrome are installed on the machines, or Safari if you are an Apple user. We will then login to RStudio Cloud using your personalised account. If you would like to use your own laptop in the labs on either campus, please feel free to do so.

#### Manawatu (iMacs)

The machines we are using for the course are Apple iMacs. Please use your normal Massey username and password to login to these machines. Please remember to ignore (i.e. cancel) the dialogue box about the network when you log in.

#### Albany (PCs)

The machines are Windows PC's so logging into them should be the same as any other Massey Windows PC.

#### outside Massey 

Most likely this is your own machine, so this should not be an issue.


### Use of RStudio Cloud for this Linux practical

To start off with log into your RStudio Cloud account, and go to the `week1and2` project in the "Bootcamp_2023" workspace we used last week. In the lower left-hand side -- the area you used the console for last week -- you will see another tab called "Terminal".  This is where we are going to be working today, so click on that, and you should see something like the below.   

<img src="graphics/terminal.PNG" width="600"/>

The line that says `:/cloud/project$` is the current line that can accept input for you to do things with.  There are three things of note here:

| Part of the command  |  The response |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Our location in our environment:  | `/cloud/project`  |
| The command prompt:               | `$`  |
   
I have used a testing environment for developing these resources, so my command prompt is different when it is shown in the below.  

On the right-hand side we have "window #4", which again needs to be switched to be in the "Files" tab, as in the below.  Folders of use for today give us the following view:

<img src="graphics/updatedFileFolder.png" width="600"/>

This is the base folder for your work today, and all files for this practical have been loaded into the project for you.

At this point we will start using the University of Surrey Unix notes [^1] to go through some of the commands I used in the lecture.  I will run the practical in the same way as that one.



## Exploring our folder

Because of the RStudio Cloud setup we are using, we can start exploring the files we have (we will discuss moving around the system a little more shortly), so don't worry about the command yet, type:

```bash
$ cd Lab2UnixAndR/
```

To find out what is in this directory, type

```bash
$ ls
```
The `ls` command (lowercase 'L' and lowercase 'S') lists the contents of your current working directory, which in this case is:

<!--- ```bash
rstudio-user@application-2571986-deployment-6682510 766qp:/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR$ ls
starting.txt
```

NB: Because this location name is so long, for the sake of clarity, I will abbreviate the prompt to the end of our name and location only, thus the below is exactly the same: --->

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR$ ls
starting.txt
```

You see a file called _`starting.txt`_.  Is that all that is there?  To find out type

```bash
$ ls -a
```

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR$ ls -a
.  ..  .hiddenfile.txt  starting.txt    
```

We can now see another file called _`.hiddenfile.txt`_.  What is going on here?  Well, `ls` does not, in fact, cause all the files in your current directory to be listed, but only those ones whose name does not begin with a dot (.) Files beginning with a dot (.) are known as hidden files and usually contain important program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change them unless you are very familiar with UNIX!!



## Making and moving around directories

We will now make a subdirectory in your working directory to hold the files you will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory called FridayFolder in your current working directory type 

```bash
$ mkdir FridayFolder
```

To see the directory you have just created, type 

```bash
$ ls 
```

The command `cd`_`directory`_ means change the current working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system tree.  To change to the directory you have just made, type

```bash
$ cd FridayFolder
```

Type `ls` to see the contents (which should be empty).  Inside this directory, type 

```bash
$ ls -a
```

To see its full contents.  What else do we see here?  

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ ls -a
.  ..               
```

There are two special directories called `.` and `..`.  In UNIX, `.` means the current directory, so typing

```bash
$ cd .  {NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot}
```

means stay where you are (the _`FridayFolder`_ directory).  This may not seem very useful at first, but using `.` as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial.  `..` means the parent of the current directory, so typing

```bash
$ cd ..  {NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dots}
```

will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory). Try it now.

> __Note:__ Typing `cd` with no argument always returns you to your home directory (wherever that is set to be). This is very useful if you are lost in the file system. 

Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole filesystem. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your current directory, type `cd` to get back to your home directory and then type

```bash
$ pwd
```

With these two commands, the full pathname will look something like this - 

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ cd ..
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR$ pwd
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR
```

Please bear in mind that this will be subtly different for your computers as compared to mine.



## Pathnames

We have now gone from our test areas to the home directory for your account.  We are not working there, so to get back to our working area, type the following:

```bash
$ cd /cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder
```

This is very important, as you can see, we can move through multiple levels by typing the path to the folder.  Now type

```bash
$ ls
```

to list the contents of your _`FridayFolder`_ directory.  Again, it is empty.  Now type

```bash
$ ls backups
```

You will get a message like this -

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ ls backups
ls: cannot access 'backups': No such file or directory
```

The reason is, _`backups`_ is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory (the directory you are currently in), you must either `cd` to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your _`backups`_ directory from where you are now, you must type the following two commands:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ ls FridayFolder/backups
```

You still get the same error as the folder does not exist (yet!).

## Copying and moving files, and removing files and directories

`cp` _`<<file1>> <<file2>>`_ is the command which makes a copy of _`<<file1>>`_ in the current working directory and calls it _`<<file2>>`_.  What we are going to do now, is to take a file stored in another part of the file system, and use the `cp` command to copy it to your _`Lab2UnixAndR`_ directory.

First, `cd` to your _`Lab2UnixAndR`_ directory.

```bash
$ cd /cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder
```

Then at the UNIX prompt, type,

```bash
$ cp ../../Lab2Other/science.txt .
```

>__Note:__ Don't forget the dot `.` at the end, and the space. Remember, in UNIX, the dot means the current directory.  The above command means copy the file _`science.txt`_ to the current directory, keeping the name the same.

>**Exercise A:**
>
> Create a backup of your science.txt file by copying it to a file called science.bak.  Write the code in the box below
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>
   
`mv` _`<<file1>> <<file2>>`_ moves (or renames) _`<<file1>>`_ to _`<<file2>>`_.  To move a file from one place to another, use the `mv` command. This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with only one file rather than two.  It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory, but giving it a different name.

We are now going to move the file _`science.bak`_ to your backup directory.  Inside the _`FridayFolder`_ directory, type

```bash
$ mv science.bak backups/
```

The last backslash is important.  You get an error, like the below.

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ mv science.bak backups/
mv: failed to access 'backups/': Not a directory
```
  
>**Exercise B:**
>
> Create the backups directory inside the _`FridayFolder`_ folder and try again to move the file _`science.bak`_ to your backup directory.  Write the two lines of code you have used in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>
  
Now type `ls` and `ls backups` to see if it has worked.

To delete (remove) a file, use the `rm` command. As an example, we are going to create a copy of the _`science.txt`_ file then delete it.  Inside your _`FridayFolder`_ directory, type

```bash
$ cp science.txt tempfile.txt
$ ls
$ rm tempfile.txt 
$ ls
```

You can use the `rmdir` command to remove a directory (make sure it is empty first). Try to remove the _`backups`_ directory. You will not be able to since UNIX will not let you remove a non-empty directory.

>**Exercise C:**
>
> Create a directory called _`tempstuff`_ using `mkdir`, then remove it using the `rmdir` command.  Write the two lines of code you have used in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>
  

## Working with files

Here are a few other useful commands:

### `clear` (clear screen)

Before you start the next section, you may like to clear the terminal window of the previous commands so the output of the following commands can be clearly understood.  At the prompt, type

```bash
$ clear
```

This will clear all text and leave you with the `$` prompt at the top of the window.

### `cat` (concatenate)

The `cat` command can be used to display the contents of a file on the screen. Type:

```bash
$ cat science.txt
```

As you can see (well no actualy - see below), the file is longer than the size of the window, so it scrolls past making it unreadable.  Check this by scrolling up and down in the terminal window using the bar on the right hand side.

> __Note:__ For us in this somewhat restricted environment the way `cat` works is unconventional.  You will probably have to press [Ctrl] and [c] to stop this behaviour, and return to the command prompt.  Hence you will not see this scrolling past the screen, but that is OK for today. 

### `less`

The `less` command writes the contents of a file onto the screen a page at a time. Type

```bash
$ less science.txt
```

Press the [space-bar] if you want to see another page, and type [q] if you want to quit reading. As you can see, less is often used in preference to cat for long files.

### `head`

The `head` command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen.  First clear the screen then type

```bash
$ head science.txt
```

Then type

```bash
$ head -n 5 science.txt
```

What difference did the `-n 5` do to the `head` command?

### `tail`

The `tail` command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen.  Clear the screen and type

```bash
$ tail science.txt
```

>**Exercise D:**
>
> How can you view the last 15 lines of the file?  Write your full code in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>


## Searching files

We are going to quickly do some simple searching of our file, as well as use the command `grep`, and the utility `wc`.

Using `less`, you can search though a text file for a keyword (pattern). For example, to search through science.txt for the word 'science', type

```bash
$ less science.txt
```

then, still in less, type a forward slash [/] followed by the word to search

`/science`

As you can see, `less` finds and highlights the keyword. Type [n] to search for the next occurrence of the word and then [q] to quit.

`grep` is one of many standard UNIX utilities. It searches files for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type

```bash
$ grep science science.txt
```

As you can see, `grep` has printed out each line containing the word 'science'.  Or has it????

Try typing

```bash
$ grep Science science.txt
```

The `grep` command is case sensitive; it distinguishes between 'Science' and 'science'.  To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the `-i` option, i.e. type

```bash
$ grep -i science science.txt
```

To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the apostrophe symbol). For example, to search for 'spinning top', type

```bash
$ grep -i 'spinning top' science.txt
```

Some of the other options of grep are:
- `-v` display those lines that do NOT match 
- `-n` precede each matching line with the line number 
- `-c` print only the total count of matched lines
- 
Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can use more than one option at a time. For example, the number of lines without the words 'science' or 'Science' is

```bash
$ grep -ivc science science.txt
```

A handy little utility is the `wc` command, short for word count. To do a word count on _`science.txt`_, type

```bash
$ wc -w science.txt
```

To find out how many lines the file has, type

```bash
$ wc -l science.txt
```


## Redirection and pipes

### Redirection

Most processes initiated by UNIX commands write to the standard output (that is, they write to the terminal screen), and many take their input from the standard input (that is, they read it from the keyboard). There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal screen.  We have already seen one use of the `cat` command to write the contents of a file to the screen.  Now type `cat` without specifying a file to read

```bash
$ cat
```

Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the [Return] key.  Finally hold the [Ctrl] key down and press [d] (written as ^D for short) to end the input.

What has happened?

If you run the `cat` command without specifying a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the 'end of file' (^D) command, copies it to the standard output (the screen).

In UNIX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands.  We use the `>` symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1 containing a list of fruit, type  

```bash
$ cat > list1
```

Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one.

```bash
pear
banana
apple
[^D] 	{this means press [Ctrl] and [d] to stop}
```

What happens is the `cat` command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the `>` redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called _`list1`_.  To read the contents of the file, type

```bash
$ cat list1
```
>**Exercise E:**
>
> Using the above method, create another file called _`list2`_ containing the following fruit: 'orange', 'plum', 'mango', 'grapefruit'. Read the contents of _`list2`_.  Write your code in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>

The form `>>` appends standard output to a file. So, to add more items to the file _`list1`_, type

```bash
$ cat >> list1
```

Then type in the names of more fruit

```bash
peach
grape
orange
[^D] 	{this means press [Ctrl] and [d] to stop}
```

To read the contents of the file, type

```bash
$ cat list1
```

You should now have two files. One contains six fruit, the other contains four fruit.  We will now use the `cat` command to join (concatenate) _`list1`_ and _`list2`_ into a new file called _`bigList`_. Type

```bash
$ cat list1 list2 > bigList
```

What this is doing is reading the contents of _`list1`_ and _`list2`_ in turn, then outputting the text to the file _`bigList`_.  To read the contents of the new file, type

```bash
$ cat bigList
```

We use the `<` symbol to redirect the input of a command.  The command `sort` alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. Type

```bash
$ sort
```

Then type in the names of some animals. Press [Return] after each one.

```bash
dog
cat
bird
ape
[^D] 	{this means press [Ctrl] and [d] to stop}
```

The output will be:

```bash
ape
bird 
cat 
dog
```

Using `<` you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type

```bash
$ sort < bigList
```
and the sorted list will be output to the screen.  To output the sorted list to a file, type,

```bash
$ sort < bigList > slist
```

Use `cat` to read the contents of the file _`slist`_.


### Pipes

Pipes allow you to link commands together.  This example is slightly limited in its scope, but illustrates the principles.  

Let's consider the use of `head` again, but this time we want to sort the first 10 lines of _`science.txt`_.  One method to get a sorted list of these lines is to type,

```bash
$ head science.txt > lines.txt
$ sort < lines.txt
```

This is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary file called _`lines.txt`_ when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output of the `head` command directly to the input of the `sort` command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar `|`.  For example, typing

```bash
$ head science.txt | sort
```

will give the same result as above, but is both quicker and cleaner.  

>**Exercise F:**
>
> Using pipes, display all lines of _`list1`_ and _`list2`_ containing the letter 'p', and sort the result.  Write your answer in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>



## Wildcards and naming files

The character `*` is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more character(s) in a file (or directory) name. For example, in your _`FridayFolder`_ directory, type

```bash
$ ls list*
```

This will list all files in the current directory starting with _`list...`_.  Try typing

```bash
$ ls *list
```

This will list all files in the current directory ending with _`....list`_

The character `?` will match exactly one character.  So _`?ouse`_ will match files like house and mouse, but not grouse.   Try typing

```bash
$ ls ?list
```

We should note here that a directory is merely a special type of file. In addition, the rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories.  In naming files, characters with special meanings such as `/ * & $`, should be avoided. Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot).

File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter and may end with a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending _`.c`_, for example, _`prog1.c`_. Then in order to list all files containing C code in your home directory, you need only type `ls` _`*.c`_ in that directory.

| Good filenames| Bad filenames |
|-----|-----|
|  project.txt  |  project  |
|  my_new_project.c  |  my new project.c  |
|  john_mike.docx  |  john & mike.docx  |



## Getting help

> __Note: For us in this somewhat restricted environment the way the `man` pages work as described below is unconventional.__ I have edited this section to give you a hint as to what a more usual resonse to these commands would be. Typing the commands in our current environment will result is errors being returned.

There are online manuals which gives information about most commands. The manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type `man <<command>>` to read the manual page for a particular command.  For example, to find out more about the `wc` (word count) command, type

```bash
$ man wc
```

If this was behaving properly, you would then need to type [q] to return to the terminal prompt.  What we see instead is:

```
WC(1)                                            User Commands                                       WC(1)

NAME
       wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

SYNOPSIS
       wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

DESCRIPTION
       Print  newline,  word,  and  byte  counts  for each FILE, and a total line if more than one FILE is specified.  
       A word is a non-zero-length sequence of characters delimited by white space.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in the following order: newline, word, 
       character, byte, maximum line length.

       -c, --bytes
              print the byte counts

       -m, --chars
              print the character counts

       -l, --lines

In addition, the `whatis` command gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about options etc.  So here we see:

```bash
$ whatis wc
wc (1)               - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

```

When you are not sure of the exact name of a command, you can use the command `apropos`:

```bash
$ apropos <<keyword>>
```

will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, if you typed

```bash
$ apropos different
```
you would see the following output:

```bash

## File security

Head back to the _`FridayFolder`_ folder if you are not already there (Hint: use pwd to check where you are).  Let's look at our files with a long listing

```bash
$ ls -l
```

you will something similar to the below:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ ls -l
total 28
drwxrwxr-x 2 rstudio-user rstudio-user 4096 Jul 18 03:11 backups
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rstudio-user rstudio-user   65 Jul 18 05:11 bigList
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rstudio-user rstudio-user   37 Jul 18 05:10 list1
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rstudio-user rstudio-user   29 Jul 18 05:11 list2
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rstudio-user rstudio-user 7767 Jul 18 05:12 science.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rstudio-user rstudio-user   65 Jul 18 05:17 slist 
```

Below is the figure from the lecture to remind you of what the columns mean.  Each file (and directory) has associated security access rights, which may be found by typing `ls -l`. In the left-hand column is a 10 symbol string consisting of the symbols d, r, w, x, -, and, occasionally, s or S. If d is present, it will be at the left-hand end of the string, and indicates a directory: otherwise - will be the starting symbol of the string.

<img src="graphics/image3.gif" width="600"/>

The 9 remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and are taken as three groups of 3.

- The left group of 3 gives the file permissions for the user that owns the file (or directory) (bioinformatics in the above example); 
- The middle group gives the permissions for the group of people to whom the file (or directory) belongs (staff in the above example);
- The rightmost group gives the permissions for all others.
- The symbols r, w, etc., have slightly different meanings depending on whether they refer to a simple file or to a directory.

Access rights on files.
r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence or absence of permission to read and copy the file 
w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission (or otherwise) to change a file 
x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission to execute a file, where appropriate

Access rights on directories:
r allows users to list files in the directory;
w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it;
x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you may read files in the directory provided you have read permission on the individual files.

So, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing that file, and hence on any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree.

We can use the `chmod` command to change the permissions of a file. The options of `chmod` are in the table below.  

| Symbol |  Meaning  |
|-----|-----|
|  u  |  user  |
|  g  |  group  |
|  o  |  other  |
|  a  |  all  |
|  r  |  read  |
|  w  |  write (& delete)  |
|  x  |  execute (& access directory)  |
|  +  |  add permission  |
|  -  |  remove permission  |

For example, to remove read write and execute permissions on the file _`bigList`_ for the group and others, type

```bash
$ chmod go-rwx bigList
```

This will leave the other permissions unaffected.  Check its effect by typing `ls -l`.  To give read and write permissions on the file _`bigList`_ to all,

```bash
$ chmod a+rw bigList
```

>**Exercise G:**
>
> Try changing access permissions on the file _`science.txt`_ and on the directory backups.  Use `ls -l` to check that the permissions have changed.

##  Looking at processes

A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). To see information about your processes, with their associated PID and status, type

```bash
$ ps
```

you should see something like:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  518 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  578 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In general the shell does not return the UNIX prompt until the current process has finished executing.

Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect that the UNIX prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues executing.

To background a process, type an`&` at the end of the command line. For example, the command `sleep` waits a given number of seconds before continuing. Type

```bash
$ sleep 10
```

This will wait 10 seconds before returning the command prompt $. Until the command prompt is returned, you can do nothing except wait.  To run sleep in the background, type

```bash
$ sleep 10 &
```

you should see something like:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ sleep 10 &
[1] 588
```

The `&` runs the job in the background and returns the prompt straight away, allowing you to run other programs while waiting for that one to finish.

The first line in the above example is typed in by the user; the next line, indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. The user is be notified of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with a PID and is notified when a background process is finished. Backgrounding is useful for jobs which will take a long time to complete.  At the prompt, type

```bash
$ sleep 1000
```

You can suspend the process running in the foreground by typing ^Z, i.e. hold down the [Ctrl] key and type [z]. Then to put it in the background, type

```bash
$ bg
```

When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job number. To examine this list, type

```bash
$ jobs
```

you should see something like:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
```

To restart (foreground) a suspended process, type

```bash
$ fg %<<jobnumber>>
```

For example, to restart sleep 1000, type

```bash
$ fg %1
```

Typing `fg` with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process.  It is sometimes necessary to kill a process (for example, when an executing program is in an infinite loop).  To kill a job running in the foreground, type [^C] (control c). For example, run

```bash
$ sleep 1000
[^C]
```

Processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) and using kill PID_number

```bash
$ sleep 1000 &
$ ps
```
you should see something like:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 595
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  518 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  595 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
  596 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

So to kill off the process sleep 1000, type

```bash
$ kill 595 {your number of course will be different}
```

and then type `ps` again to see if it has been removed from the list.  If a process refuses to be killed, uses the `-9` option, i.e. type

```bash
$ kill -9 595 
```

Note: It is not possible to kill off other users' processes !!!



## Other useful commands

### `df`

This command reports on the space left on the file system. For example, to find out how much space is left on the machine, type

```bash
$ df .
```

### `du`

This command outputs the number of kilobyes used by each subdirectory. Useful if you have gone over quota and you want to find out which directory has the most files. In your _`Lab2UnixAndR`_ directory, type

```bash
$ du -s *
```

The `-s` flag will display only a summary (total size) and the `*` means all files and directories.

### `gzip`
This reduces the size of a file, thus freeing valuable disk space. For example, move to the _`FridayFolder`_ and type

```bash
$ ls -l science.txt
```

and note the size of the file using `ls -l`. Then to compress _`science.txt`_, type

```bash
$ gzip science.txt
```

This will compress the file and place it in a file called _`science.txt.gz`_.

To see the change in size, type `ls -l` again.  To expand the file, use the `gunzip` command.

```bash
$ gunzip science.txt.gz
```

### `zcat`

`zcat` will read gzipped files without needing to uncompress them first.  Go back and repeat the compression of _`science.txt`_, and then type

```bash
$ zcat < science.txt.gz
```

If the text scrolls too fast for you, pipe the output though less.

```bash
$ zcat < science.txt.gz | less
```

### `file`

This classifies the named files according to the type of data they contain, for example ascii (text), pictures, compressed data, etc.. To report on all files in your home _`FridayFolder`_, type

```bash
$ file *
```

you should see something like:

```bash
/cloud/project/Lab2UnixAndR/FridayFolder$ file *
backups:        directory
bigList:        ASCII text
list1:          ASCII text
list2:          ASCII text
science.txt.gz: gzip compressed data, was "science.txt", last modified: Sat Jul 18 05:12:00 2020, from Unix
slist:          ASCII text
```

### `diff`

This command compares the contents of two files and displays the differences. Suppose you have a file called _`file1`_ and you edit some part of it and save it as _`file2`_. To see the differences type

```bash
$ diff file1 file2
```

Lines beginning with a `<` denotes _`file1`_, while lines beginning with a `>` denotes _`file2`_.

### `find`

This searches through the directories for files and directories with a given name, date, size, or any other attribute you care to specify. It is a simple command but with many options - you can read the manual by typing `man find`.

### `history`

The C shell keeps an ordered list of all the commands that you have entered. Each command is given a number according to the order it was entered.

```bash
$ history (show command history list)
```

If you are using the C shell, you can use the exclamation character (!) to recall commands easily.

```bash
$ !! (recall last command)
$ !-3 (recall third most recent command)
$ !5 (recall 5th command in list)
$ !grep (recall last command starting with grep)
```

You can increase the size of the history buffer by typing

```bash
$ set history=100
```


## The environment

Variables are a way of passing information from the shell to programs when you run them. Programs look "in the environment" for particular variables and if they are found will use the values stored. Some are set by the system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program.

Standard UNIX variables are split into two categories, environment variables and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current instance of the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions; environment variables have a farther-reaching significance, and those set at login are valid for the duration of the session. By convention, environment variables have UPPER CASE and shell variables have lower case names.

An example of an environment variable is the OSTYPE variable. The value of this is the current operating system you are using. Type

```bash
$ echo $OSTYPE
```

More examples of environment variables are:

- USER (your login name)
- HOME (the path name of your home directory)
- HOST (the name of the computer you are using)
- DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows)
- PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command)
- LANG (the language you are using)

Try a few out yourself to set what is known about your machine.

>**Exercise H:**
>
> What is the name of your OS? Write the name in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>

ENVIRONMENT variables are set using the `setenv` command, displayed using the `printenv` or `env` commands, and unset using the `unsetenv` command.  To show all values of these variables, type

```bash
$ printenv | less
```

Remember to use the space bar to see the full output as we are using the less command. You will also need to type [Q] to leave the `printenv` report.



## A small exercise with the stream editor sed

### Making a new file

As mentioned in the lecture, the command line is very powerful and there are programs and utilities like `sed` that can do many things for us.  We are going to explore this in a small exercise [^3].

First of all we will head back to our starting location, and then we need a new text file, so we will use one of the licence agreements that are part of Linux:

```bash
$ cd /cloud/project
$ cp /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD .
```

Let's use `sed` to view the contents of the BSD license file.

```bash
$ sed '' BSD
```

You'll see the BSD license displayed to the screen.

### Printing Lines

In the previous example, you saw that input passed into `sed` without any operations would print the results directly to STDOUT.  Let's explore sed's explicit print command, which you specify by using the p character within single quotes, so type:

```bash
$ sed 'p' BSD
```

You'll see each line of the BSD file is printed twice due to the way that `sed` works, a line at a time.  This is not all that useful, so let's suppress this automatic activity with the -n option.

```bash
$ sed -n 'p' BSD
```

### Ranges of Output

Taking the idea of targeting parts of this text stream, we can specify a range.  So to print out the first line only, type:

```bash
$ sed -n '1p' BSD
```

This is called an address range, even though it is only one line.  We can also print ranges, such as:

```bash
$ sed -n '1,5p' BSD
```

which will print out the first 5 lines.  Do you think this is more powerful than the commands `head` or `tail`?

We can print every other line, specify the interval after the `~` character. The following command prints every other line in the BSD file, starting with line 1:

```bash
$ sed -n '1~2p' BSD
```

### Substituting Text

Perhaps the most well-known use for `sed` is substituting text.  `sed` can search for text patterns using regular expressions, and then replace the found text with something else.  Regular expressions are beyond the scope of this course, but we will look at a few simple examples to illustrate the principles.  From the lecture we saw that in its most basic form, you can change one word to another word using the following syntax, as in this example:

```bash
<< 's/old_word/new_word/' >>
```

The `s` is the substitute command. The three slashes (/) are used to separate the different text fields, this is called a delimiter. You can use other characters to delimit the fields if it would be more helpful, but that is not for now.  So how does this work in practice? 

 Let's replace or substitute the word "the" with the word "our", so type:

```bash
$ sed 's/the/our/' BSD
```

You see the updated BSD output printed to screen.  This is great but how do we find out which lines were affected?  We can use the `-n` option to suppress the automatic printing, and then the `p` flag after the last delimiter in the substitute command.  See what effect this has by typing:

```bash
$ sed -n 's/the/our/p' BSD
```

There are other options in the substitute command for the position of the last delimiter, such as `'g'` for global changes, `'i'` for case insensitive changes and `'1'` and `'2'` for the first or second occurrence respectively. What do you see when you type:

```bash
$ sed -n 's/the/our/1p' BSD
```
>**Exercise I:**
>
> What is the sed command to substitute 'the' with 'quote' in a case-insensitive manner.  Write the code in the box below:
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>

A final point is that I would look very carefully at the way this substitution works, e.g. with the line that starts "3. Neither...".  Have a think about how you could modify your statement to prevent this behaviour from happening.


## Conclusion of the practical

One last question: if you take the following characters from the first lines of code from the following short exercises, what three words do you end up with?  The rows in italics define the words. __Count only alphabetical characters from the first to the last, and ignore spaces.__  Write your answer below:

> _Exercise A:_	character 3
>
> Exercise B:	character 8
> 
> Exercise D:	character 3
> 
> Exercise C:	character 7
> 
> Exercise A: character 7, character 1, character 6
> 
> _Exercise I:_	character 10, character 1
> 
> Exercise I:	character 2, character 5
> 
> _Exercise H:_	characters 1 to 5
>
> <table><tr><td>
> ____________________
> </td></tr></table>


That is today’s practical completed.

## Assessment

To reiterate, for this, the second lab of this course, there is no direct assessment today.  What is required however, is an understanding of the principles we have learnt today, as these will be required for two things:

1. For the mastery test which accounts for 15% of the course. This will take place between Thursday 23-Mar-2023 and Friday 24-Mar-2023 online.
2. For a part of this course in which you will use RStudio to explore examples of genomic data.

The mastery test will test both Linux and R, so half of the marks will come from each part.  We have not done much biology today, but as a hint have a think about how we can work with biological data that can come in a variety of formats (e.g. sequences files in say fasta format) and what we can potentially do with those given what we have learnt today.  There will be a worksheet with test questions for you to work through as preparation for the test.
